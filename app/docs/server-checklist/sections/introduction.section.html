  <p><b>server-checklist</b> is a detailed checklist that is routinely executed by the developer team to maintain and monitor servers, solutions and products. The checklist is estimated to take less than 20 minutes if no actionable items are found. Many potential common issues can be mitigated by routine oversight.
