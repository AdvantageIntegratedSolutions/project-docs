	<doc-caption>Nothing new to learn. The folder organization will do most of the work.</doc-caption>

	<p>All documentation is stored within the <a href="https://github.com/KitHensel/project-docs" target="_blank">project-docs</a> Angular QuickStart application.</p>

	<p>Each documented project has its own folder under the "/docs" folder making it clear and easy-to-organize and find documentation. Inside each folder is an index.doc.html file and a 'sections' folder.</p>

	<p>Once your folder structure is setup, everything else is automatic including the routing, side-navigation, and making your project visible to the team on the dashboard.</p>
