	<doc-caption>Nothing new to learn. The folder organization will do most of the work.</doc-caption>

	<p>All documentation is stored under the "/docs" folder within the <a href="https://github.com/KitHensel/project-docs" target="_blank">project-docs</a> Angular QuickStart application. Each documented project has a folder titled after the project name making it clear and easy to organize documentation. Inside each folder is an index.doc.html file and a 'sections' folder that contains each section of documentation.</p>
	
	<h5>Steps to document a new project:</h5>

	<ol>
		<li>Add a new folder under "/docs", titling it with the name of your project.</li>
