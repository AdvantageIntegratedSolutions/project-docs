  <doc-caption>Perform all of your development locally.</doc-caption>

  <p>All development and testing can be done locally by launching a local server. Due to cross-origin restrictions all QuickBase API requests will be made through a AWS lambda proxy. This is all done automatically when building within <b>quickstart-angular</b>.
	</p>

	To launch your local server run the below command at the root of your project:
	<doc-command>gulp local</doc-command>

	<p>Once your local server has successfully launched, a tab should automatically open in your default browser at localhost:3000.</p>

	<p>Now that we are up and running, any saved changes to any of your application code will automatically trigger a refresh of your browser window.</p> 

	<doc-notice>Any syntax errors will be caught and will not crash your server. If something isn't refreshing correctly, ensure to revisit your terminal to track any logged errors.</doc-notice>
