  <p>When you are ready to deploy your application, you can deploy your application straight from your console. <b>quickstart-angular</b> currently only supports automated deployment to a QuickBase application. If you need to deploy to a different platform, you can manually copy the auto-compiled files in your /tmp folder.
	</p>

	<p>To deploy your application, shut down your local server and run:</p>

	<doc-command>gulp deploy</doc-command>

	<p>Running 'gulp deploy' will ensure all of your source-code is recompiled, minified, paths are resolved and files are uploaded to QuickBase. Your distribution code will be stored in the /dist folder and each file will be prefixed with the name of your application configured in /config/app.config.js.</p>

	<doc-warning>If pages in QuickBase already exist within the QuickBase application and your /dist filenames match the existing pagenames, the existing QuickBase pages will be overwritten.</doc-warning>
