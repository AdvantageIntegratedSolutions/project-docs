  <p>Filters can be applied directly on the rendered calendar. By default the calendar will render all assets found in the source data report and then be filtered down from there.</p>

  <p>Filters are hardcoded in the calendar and require adjustments to calendar if new filters are required.</p>

  <p>All filters indivdually are treated as OR's conditions, but all filter together are combined as an AND condition.</p>

  <h5>Example:</h5>
  <pre class="language-javascript">
    <code>
    Site Filter -> [ 'MCR', 'Diet Coke' ] -> Site is either 'MCR' or 'Diet Coke'

    AND 

    Group Filter -> [ 'Social', 'Outbound' ] -> Group is either 'Social' or 'Outbound'
    </code>
  </pre>
