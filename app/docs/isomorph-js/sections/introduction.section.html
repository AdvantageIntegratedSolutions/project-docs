  <p><b>isomorph-js</b> is a tool that enables execution of client-side JavaScript code on the server.</p>

  <p>Instead of having to endure a lengthy deployment and testing process for a simple script in Rails, <b>isomorph-js</b> gives you the option to keep all of your code in QuickBase.</p>

  <p>The most common use case for <b>isomorph-js</b> at the time of this writing is for webhooks, but there are plans to develop a scheduling feature in the near future.</p>
